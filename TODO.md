# TODOs

Short overview over project TODOs.

## First plots

- [ ] Determine a definition for "cold": plot histograms for the gas temperature of 
  - [ ] Halos in different mass bins (individual)
  - [ ] Halos in different mass bins (stacked)
  - [ ] All halos in total
- [ ] Determine the trend of the gas mass with halo mass: plot trend for
  - [ ] cold gas mass vs. halo mass
  - [ ] cold gas mass fraction vs. halo mass
  - [ ] cold gas mass in primary halo vs. halo mass
  - [ ] cold gas mass fraction in primary halo vs. halo mass
