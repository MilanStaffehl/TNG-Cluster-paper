# Roadmap

A brief overview over the steps taken. The numbers match the subdirectory names in the directories `scripts/`, `figures/` and `data/`. 

## 001: Temperature distributions

**Task:** Plot the distribution of gas temperature in different mass bins.

**Goal:** Determine what temperature can be used to separate cold from hot gas or cold from warm and warm from hot gas.

**Result:** pending

GitHub issues for tasks:

- [ ] [#4 Plot: plot temperature distribution in halos](https://github.com/MilanStaffehl/thesisProject/issues/4)
- [x] [#10 Adjust: adjust the plots of temperature distribution](https://github.com/MilanStaffehl/thesisProject/issues/10)
- [ ] [#11 Plot: distribution of temperatures weighted by mass](https://github.com/MilanStaffehl/thesisProject/issues/11)
- [ ] [#13 Plot: treat star-forming gas differently in plot](https://github.com/MilanStaffehl/thesisProject/issues/13)

## 002: Gas mass trends with halo mass

**Task:** Plot the trend of cold, warm and hot gas mass (fraction) with halo mass.

**Goal:** Determine whether the cut-off temperature needs to vary with mass or if it is constant across halo masses.

**Result:** pending

GitHub issues for tasks:

- [ ] [#7 Plot: determine trend of cold gas mass with halo mass](https://github.com/MilanStaffehl/thesisProject/issues/7)
- [ ] [#12 Plot: determine gas mass vs. halo mass for all regimes](https://github.com/MilanStaffehl/thesisProject/issues/12)
